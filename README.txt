# Welcome to My Projects Repo!

This repository contains a collection of projects I've worked on from mid 2022 to August 2023, and I'll likely be adding more as I continue to create.

## Android (Java):

### Workout App:
- Created during the semester break of 2023 to prepare for my app development course in semester 2 of 2023.
- An app that provides users with various workouts. Users can click on workouts to view details and use a stopwatch fragment for timing.
- Works seamlessly on both phones and tablets, with adaptive display adjustments.

## C++:

### hotelManager.cpp:
- Developed in mid 2022 to enhance my understanding of C++ and object-oriented programming.
- A terminal-based C++ program allowing users to manage a hotel. Users can set up room details, costs, and options, including booking status.
- Includes an additional custom header file 'hotelManager.h' for extra functionality.

## C:

### caesar.c:
- Crafted during my study of CS50 in mid 2022.
- A program that encrypts text using a Caesar cipher based on a user-input key.
- Shifts letters of input phrase forward or backward in the alphabet, supporting positive and negative key values.
- Example: `./caesar 3` with plaintext 'Hello, World!" results in scrambled output 'Khoor, Zruog!"

### runoff.c:
- Created in mid 2022 as part of my CS50 studies.
- Simulates a run-off election with user-input candidates and voter preferences.
- Calculates and displays the winner of the election or a draw outcome.

### scrabble.c:
- Developed in mid 2022 during CS50.
- A program that scores two player-input words based on Scrabble letter values, determining the winner.
- Provides error checking to ensure single-word input from players.

## CyberSecurity:

### PortScanner:
- A collection of scripts created in July 2023 for learning cybersecurity concepts.
- Python script for port scanning with multithreading to enhance speed.
- Scans specified IP address and ports, printing open ports to the terminal.

### WireSharkGeoTracker:
- A simple Python script using Wireshark packet capturing to display source locations of captured packets.

### dictPasswordCracker:
- Collection of scripts and text files for password cracking exercises.
- Includes a list of common passwords and hashed values.
- HashMaker.py generates hashed_values.txt using various algorithms.
- dictCracker.py matches hashed values to passwords and displays results.

## Java:

### ComputerStoreSwingGUI:
- Created in mid 2023 while studying OOP at university.
- GUI application for a computer store using Java Swing.
- Supports manager and salesperson logins, displaying devices in a table.
- Managers can edit existing devices and add new ones, with sorting and filtering options.

### LibraryCatalogue:
- Terminal-based Java program from mid-2023, displaying a list of items from a supplied text file.
- Users can navigate through the menu, sort the list, search, rent, return, and rate items.

## Networking:

### Subnet Network Configuration:
- Subnetted network configuration created in GNS3 to understand IP addressing and subnetting.
- Features 4 routers, 4 subnets with varying user capacities, and 4 VPCs per subnet.
- All routers and VPCs can ping each other.

## Python:

### Runner Game - Pygame Intro:
- Side-scrolling runner game developed in late 2022 to learn Python and Pygame.
- Play by pressing spacebar to jump over enemies and increase your score.
- Features start screen, in-game action, and end screen with final score.

### Tournament Simulator:
- Created during CS50 studies in 2022.
- Simulates FIFA World Cup using CSV files with real-world data on country statistics.
- Runs 1000 simulations and displays the likelihood of each country winning the tournament.

Feel free to explore these projects and learn more about each one!
